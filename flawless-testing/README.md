# Flawless testing for the functional folks

The year is 2019 and there have never been more people writing functional Scala. We’ve grown tired of frameworks, magic (reflection) and omnipotent testing libraries with hundreds of testing styles. I want to fight back against tests that stop on the first failed assertion. Against `beforeAll` and `afterEach`.
I want to seek vengeance for unexpected, globally configured test parallelism and flaky tests. I want to rethink how we test pure and effective functional code and show another approach to doing it in Scala. In this talk, I will share what I’ve learned trying to make that approach become a reality. We’ll talk about the characteristics of test frameworks, functional API design and making trade-offs.
